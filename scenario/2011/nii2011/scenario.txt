Alice is a student in Computer Science. In the afternoon, she has a lecture on project
management. Usually it is held in a classical amphitheater, but today she receives a message on her
PDA that it will be held in a new laboratory in her university, called the SmartRoom. The message
also contains indications on how to get there.

She is a bit late and she is the last one of the 15 students to arrive. When all students are in the
room, all lights go down automatically, the presentation screen turns on showing the first slide of
today's lecture, and the teacher starts the presentation. There are microphones for each student in the
room, as well as for the teacher, but only the teacher's microphone is on for the time of the
presentation. Later, during the time for questions, the students' microphones get activated as well.

Students are divided into a pros-group and a cons-group of a subject. For each group, pros/cons
members do brainstorming about reasons why they agree or disagree with the subject. Students
write opinions down on their PDAs. The opinion is tied to user information of person who wrote it.
Then, a discussion will follow. During the discussion, opinions that people around the  table wrote 
appear on the table display, to support  discussion. Finally, each group draws a conclusion, and
presents it by using main display.

At the end of the activities, the teacher passes by each group of students and evaluates their
work, using an application on his PDA. After evaluation and comments, the students' work is saved, 
and as they go back to their seats the screens turn off automatically. Before leaving, a message on 
the students' PDAs asks them to give anonymous feedback on the lecture. After everybody leaves the 
room, the lights go out all by themselves.
