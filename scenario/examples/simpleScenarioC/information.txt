2 containers, 4 agents: initially root has the children master and roaming, roaming has the child slave. Slave knows who is the master of roaming.

When the go-gather message is issued (also see NOTE 1), root sends it to roaming, roaming asks slave for the information, slave gives it the info, and roaming moves, together with its subtree (slave).

String comparison is implemented in the java code attachment.


Features:
  - knowledge as parameter
  - using the knowledge base
  - mobility
  - one agent class for more agents
  - the agent automatically receives its name and parent as parameter
  - java functions
  
NOTE 1:
  - the intention was to activate all behaviors with a message of the same type (protocol), but due to issue #1 this is not yet possible. Therefore, the (condition) statements are useless. 

NOTE 2:
  - one error expected at execution: for root, no parent parameter is given, so at instantiation it is unable to bind variable ?parent.
